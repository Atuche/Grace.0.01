ðŸ“Œ Project Overview: Grace â€“ WhatsApp Wholesale Assistant for AkanrabyAtuche
 Project Goal
Grace is an intelligent, WhatsApp-based sales assistant designed to streamline and automate the wholesale sales process for AkanrabyAtuche, a fashion-forward brand specializing in vibrant prints and custom dresses. Built with Flask, Twilio, OpenAI GPT, and SQLite, Grace handles everything from initial customer engagement to fabric selection, payment confirmation, and order trackingâ€”while maintaining a tone that blends professionalism with persuasive, brand-aligned humor.

Core Capabilities
Conversational Sales Assistant
Grace mimics a persuasive, deal-closing human assistant. Sheâ€™s designed to reduce response delays and close sales efficiently.

Memory & Personalization
Grace uses an SQLite database to remember previous interactions, payment statuses, and customer preferences, enabling personalized experiences.

Fabric Selection Workflow
Grace requests dress images from customers, sends back available fabric print options from the catalog, and helps customers make selections.

Order Confirmation & Payment Requests
After a customer selects prints, Grace generates a summary with a 50% deposit request, provides payment instructions, and requests proof of payment.

Smart Payment Confirmation
Upon receiving a screenshot or notification of payment, Grace logs the confirmation and notifies the operations team to verify and proceed.

Humor-Driven Redirection
Grace politely (but humorously) redirects off-topic messages like trivia, flattery, or idle chats back to the goal: getting paid and moving products.
